=====
Some popular fonts only display the embossed dot by default, which is *NOT* friendly for the beginner from the sighted and amblyopia to learn, as well as the teacher to prepare the teaching material.

It's easy to spot that dot(1) is not dot(3) on such scale, but it'll be not that easy when it's within a tofu-like square inside a line.
